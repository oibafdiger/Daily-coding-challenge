Digit Rotation Escape
Given a positive integer, determine if it, or any of its rotations, is evenly divisible by its digit count.

A rotation means to move the first digit to the end. For example, after 1 rotation, 123 becomes 231.

Check rotation 0 (the given number) first.
Given numbers won't contain any zeros.
Return the first rotation number if one is found, or "none" if not.
Tests:
Passed:1. get_rotation(123) should return 0.
Passed:2. get_rotation(13579) should return 3.
Passed:3. get_rotation(24681) should return "none".
Passed:4. get_rotation(84138789345) should return 6.
